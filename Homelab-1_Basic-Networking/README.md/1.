# Homelab 1: Basic Router–Switch–PC Connectivity

## Tool Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Objective
To build a basic network topology and understand fundamental
network communication between devices.

## Lab Topology
- 1 Router
- 1 Layer 2 Switch
- 2 End Devices (PCs)

## Configuration Performed
- Connected router, switch, and PCs
- Assigned IP addresses and subnet mask
- Configured default gateway
- Verified connectivity using ping

## Validation
- Successful ICMP communication between PCs and router
- Verified interface status using CLI commands

## SOC Relevance
- Learned how normal network traffic looks
- Understood baseline connectivity behavior
- Built foundation for detecting abnormal network activity

## Evidence
Refer to the attached PDF for topology and configuration screenshots.
