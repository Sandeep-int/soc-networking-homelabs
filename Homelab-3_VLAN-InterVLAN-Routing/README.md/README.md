# Homelab 3: VLAN Segmentation & Inter-VLAN Routing

## Tool Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer

## Objective
To simulate a segmented enterprise network using VLANs and
implement inter-VLAN routing for controlled communication.

## Lab Architecture
- Router
- Layer 2 Switch
- Multiple PCs
- Multiple VLANs (Office, IT, Guest)

## Configuration Performed
- Created VLANs on the switch
- Assigned access ports to VLANs
- Configured trunk port (802.1Q)
- Implemented router sub-interfaces
- Enabled DHCP for multiple VLANs

## Testing & Validation
- Verified IP assignment per VLAN
- Tested inter-VLAN connectivity using ping
- Confirmed isolation between VLANs

## Troubleshooting
- Encountered DHCP and VLAN-related issues
- Verified trunk configuration
- Fixed routing and DHCP misconfiguration

## SOC Relevance
- Understood network segmentation concepts
- Learned how VLAN issues impact security monitoring
- Built awareness of firewall, IDS, and SIEM alert behavior
- Practiced escalation-ready troubleshooting

## Evidence
Refer to the attached PDF for topology and configuration details.
